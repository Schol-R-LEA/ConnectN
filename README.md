# ConnectN
An extensible version of Connect-4 with a resizeable game board and modifiable win condition.

The text UI game takes five positional, optional arguments, representing the size of the game square, the number of tokens in a row 
needed to win, which player goes first, whether the second player is human or the computer solver, and the search depth for the computer
player.
